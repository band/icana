2024-09-24: is there something to this idea:
 >  the reason I'm worried about AI is because I'm worried for AI
  - from [[2023-12 Octavia Nouzen]]  

2024-10-14: 
/- when human intelligence is reduced to machine intelligence, or vice-versa, then perhaps there will be worries for all of us /
/- one current musing:  whatever is happening inside an AI or LLM system that we are referring to as "thinking",-- that is not what I am doing when, before going to sleep, I put my head on a pillow and reflect on the few paragraphs I just finished reading /  
/- is it? /
/- or when I take a walk the next day and think again about enchantment and rationality, and ethics and morals, some ideas that I have been reading and wondering about for some months now /

a couple of excerpts from the last year or so of reading seem _a propos_:
