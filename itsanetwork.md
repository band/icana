# 2024-08-09 itâ€™s a network

// decentralized and an idiosyncratic federation /
TODO: find shorter words. 
  - idiosyncratic: intrinsic, unique, distinctive
  - decentralized: separated, inter-dependent and independent
// in a graph nodes and links can have metadata /
// nodes and links provide context information about each other and the relationships /
// pick a network up by one node and shake it and you might represent a hierarchy /
// wiki ways: pages and links amongst them /
// inter wiki links: how to specify, how to support two-way linking /
// how much metadata and property information can links carry? /
//- TODO: find current thinking on the kinds of network, or graph, links /

## an inter-wiki link experiment. 
- link from <bandstands.praxis101.net> to a node in <anagora.org>.
