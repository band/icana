# 2022-10-13 connecting notes

1. this is the start of some experiments and trials at trying to connect notes to more than one client; in this case iA-Writer and Obsidian.
2. one aim to be able to create a Massive Wiki folder that is shared between the two apps, and, then, also managed in a Github repository.
3. however, i am not quite sure how to make this work.

Step 1. create a note (this one) using iA-Writer and storing it in the iCloud folder `theVeryIdea` (DONE?: check name)
Step 2. create the associated GitHub repo (TODO)

wikilink using iAWriter: [[thinking about ...]]  


Observation: Obsidian mobile and desktop seem to have similar interfaces; so that is good.
iA-Writer, on the other hand, shows the Obsidian files in a “From Other Apps” list in the sidebar, along with all files that are from other apps. It would be nice to figure out how to keep this Obsidian vault’s contents in its own folder; at least for display and access.
