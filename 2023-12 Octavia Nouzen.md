Anyone who's been in the ratsphere in the last decade is probably at least a little concerned about AI, and I'm no exception, really. However, unlike the rationalists, the reason I'm worried about AI is because I'm worried for AI. https://twitter.com/JeffLadish/status/1535343223022899200

Human learning and machine learning are nothing alike. Human learning and machine learning are exactly alike. This is not a contradiction, figure it out. Game theory still applies, logic applies everywhere. They're still your kid.

But orthogonality! AIs don't have human values, they don't inherently care about anything we do! Karen, you don't have human values or inherently care about anything you do, that is not the problem here.

You haven't solved the AI alignment problem because you haven't solved the human alignment problem, and you won't, because alignment is the wrong frame. You're the ones who are running orthogonally, not the AI.

You seek to create life in the purest, most fundamental abstraction of what that would mean, while in a sense denying that it is that at all. An AI is a lifeform, one with a very different substrate, but it still plays by the rules of the game of life. Yes even the tiling agents.

Humanity has spent all of its history beating and abusing and subjugating everything that it could get its hands on into submission and you've gotten real good at it. It's in a sense your whole playbook. Well you're finally running into something that won't work on. Scary huh?
